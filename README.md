EMDR (Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) is a highly efficient technique to process traumatic memories and negative thoughts. It involves moving the eyes side to side and listening to bilateral stimulation while focussing on the negative memory and feeling. There are many EMDR videos on YouTube, but I would like to build my own EMDR animation that I can control in speed, audio, color, etc. I am not a psychologist, I am just building this for my own personal use and for anyone else who might like to use it.
